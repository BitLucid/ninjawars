<p>Hailing from the icy steppes of upstate New York, Roy got his first computer at the ripe old age of 14, and has been addicted to computers ever since.  He's worked in IT fixing computers, and eventually decided that the web is the future, got in on the action, and hasn't looked back.  Since 2003, he's been working in php and webdesign, which he got started on from working on ninjawars.net. </p>
<p>Roy is almost done with a BS degree in Biochemistry from SUNY Geneseo.  He says it was an accident.  Luckily he also took programming classes along the way, and liked them.</p>
<p>When he's able to overcome his attachment to instantaneous communication and exchange of ideas (i.e. the internet), he truly enjoys swimming and walking dogs, even if they are someone else's dogs.</p>
