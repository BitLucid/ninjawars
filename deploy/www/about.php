<p>The game is mainly one of fighting against other ninja.
Once you are a ninja, you can:</p>
<p>
<ul>
    <li>Kill townsfolk (click on the combat link, and then click the link for a thief, villager, or merchant, the easiest targets).
    </li>
    <li>Kill other ninja! (click on the "ninjas" link and go the last page, click a ninja, and then click "attack" to attack them)
        <div>use your skills or items to make more effective attacks.</div>
    </li>
    <li>If you die, just drag your ghost to the shrine and the monks will bring you back! (click on the "resurrect" link)
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
You can buy items to help your attack at the shop, but you'll need to work in the fields to get gold to buy stuff with.
</p>
<p>
Once you get enough kills, you can level up at the dojo.
