<p>The monk meditates for a moment, then passes his hand over your forehead. A black fog passes over your vision and you feel a moment of dizziness.</p>
<p>For a moment you become aware of the dirt on the walls, the darkness in the room, a <a href='npc.php?victim=spider' class='npc'>Spider</a> crawling across the wall.</p>
<p>He hands you a scroll that seems to writhe with shadows.</p>
