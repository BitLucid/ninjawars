<p>
  The game is mainly one of fighting against other ninja. Once you are a ninja, you can:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Kill townsfolk (click on the combat link, and then click the link for a thief, villager, or merchant, the easiest targets).</li>
  <li>
     Kill other ninja! (click on the "ninjas" link and go the last page, click a ninja, and then click "attack" to attack them)
     <div>use your skills or items to make more effective attacks.</div>
  </li>
  <li>If you die, just drag your ghost to the shrine and the monks will bring you back! (click on the "resurrect" link)</li>
</ul>

<p>
  You can buy items to help your attack at the shop, but you'll need to work in the fields to get gold to afford anything.
</p>

<p>
  Once you get enough kills, you can level up at the dojo.
