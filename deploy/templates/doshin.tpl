    You walk up to the Doshin Office to find the door locked. The Doshin are busy protecting the borders of the village from thieves.
  </p>
  <p>
      Nearby on a wall is a notice that <strong>Commoners found carrying katana will be imprisoned.</strong> Nailed to the door is an official roster of wanted criminals and the bounties offered for their heads.
  </p>
  <p>
    A few men that do seem to be associated with the doshin doze near the entrance. Every so often someone approaches and slips them something that clinks and jingles.

    <span class="speech">This black mist weather we have today makes it hard to see some things,</span> one of the Doshin tells you as he palms your gold. He then directs you out through a back alley.

    You find yourself in a dark alley. A rat scurries by. To your left lies the main street of the village.

{elseif $location eq 2}

    <span class="speech">Trying to steal from the Doshin, eh!</span> one of the men growls.
  </p>
  <p>
    Where before there were only relaxing men idly ignoring their duties there are now unsheathed katanas and glaring eyes.
  </p>
  <p>
    A group of the Doshin advance on you before you can escape and proceed to rough you up with fists and the hilts of their katana. Finally, they take most of your gold and toss you into the alley behind the building.
  </p>
  <p>
    Bruised and battered, you find yourself in a dark alley. A rat scurries by. To your left lies the main street of the village.
