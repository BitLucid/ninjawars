<div class='description'>
You enter the steaming confines of the bath house.
A Geisha takes your clothes and concealed weaponry with a knowing smile.
Shedding your clothes, you ease into a large copper tub that is filled with steaming water and exotic bath salts.
<p>While your tensions melt away, you listen to the conversations around you that carry through the paper thin walls, telling of legendary exploits and dark deeds.</p>
