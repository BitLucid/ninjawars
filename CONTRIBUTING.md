* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so we can avoid regression later.
* Manually test that your test site doesn't break!
* Commit just the modifications, do not mess with the composer.json files.
* Ensure that all tests pass.
* Send the pull request.
* Check that the Test CI build passes (check the badges/checks). If not, rinse and repeat.
