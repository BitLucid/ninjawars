Learning how to use the git app on your local machine is highly recommended for any programmer or webdesigner, though there's a high initial learning curve.  My recommendation in that area is to try setting up git-tortoise as a really simple solution to starting to harness git's power.
To get a sense of it, read git_developer_tools_urls.txt in the /docs/ folder, which will point the way towards git tools to download on windows and mac, as git is native to linux.
