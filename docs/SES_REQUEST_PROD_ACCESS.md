NinjaWars is a 20 year old web roleplaying game provides a text-based roleplaying experience 
to people who join the web app.  
The NinjaWars web game only ever emails 2 groups of people: 1) users of the site who signed up for an account, 2) administrators of the game system who monitor and moderate the game content. In both cases, these emails are 100% transactional. Email is used primarily for account verification and password reset. 2 additional email-based workflows are supported but optional. A) The players of the game can opt-in to have regularly scheduled digests of their notifications delivered to them via email. This information is generally identical to the messages they would receive by logging in to the system, but some players prefer to receive a digest so they don't log in when there is nothing new to act on. The emails are transactional and communicative in nature, and are limited in frequency.
No marketing emails are sent from the system.

 

After first auto-reply:

> For example, tell us how often you send email, how you maintain your recipient lists, and how you manage bounces, complaints, and unsubscribe requests. It is also helpful to provide examples of the email you plan to send so we can ensure that you are sending high-quality content.

Emails are sent once per new user creation. Users can sign up while creating a profile in the main game. Emails are sent once every time a user requests a password reset. Signup and password reset emails are transactional from user actions, so recipients are limited to actively engaged players (<100 weekly players usually) and administrators receiving daily stats. Because volume is so low, bounces are handled manually by routing bounces to the inboxes of system administrators through the use of a distribution list. All emails are transactional so unsubscribing is generally not possible, apart from logging in to delete one's account. It would not be possible for people to access their accounts without receiving email. Examples of emails: (new user sign up) Hello, <user>! Your requested a new game player account on NinjaWars. Click the link below to log in and get started. (scheduled digest) Hello, <user>, here is your daily digest of game notifications. Remember you can always change your digest settings from your profile in the game, or turn off email notifications in your account settings <here>. * New messages sent to you (16) <link> * New Items for your viewing (8) <link>
This is the extent of the emails that are sent by the game system
