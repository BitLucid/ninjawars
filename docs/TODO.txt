Explain the avatars on the stats page

Attributes:
Turn classes from colors to elements, void fire water earth air
Need a much much much much better "affect" system.
Make skills independent of classes and based on levelling up instead, preferrably choice-based.
Integrate the energy stat into the game.
Badges marking accomplishments.
Karma for a silly social rating, and possibly for some simple non-combat benefit usages.

Actions:
Create the ability for players to set up "ambush" from their profile when viewers wander in to view it.
Kappa random encounter as a money source? Tengu random encounter useful for ???
And random encounter generator to javascript and internal php that cause random encounters when the two systems match up?
Invitation quest, eventually, once the game is more interesting and fun, once per month, perhaps accompanied by a quest/time completed marker in general, using a quests database.

UI:
Make the chat (and eventually the main iFrame) use js/jQuery instead of the horribleness that it is now,
and make sure that the content is coming out correctly, like that apostrophes are working in chats.
Make the main page and list_all_players page search forms default to showing dead ninja results.
Make search assume show_dead
Make a "embeddable" thing that can show your ninja's current rank and avatar and title.
Cleanup the main page for speed.
Health displayed as a bar percentage...

Levelling:
Auto-levelling checks instead of kills banking.
Make customizations/benefits for levelling then make killpoints gaining more realistic.
Make the highest level confer the title of "emperor" on that player.

Backup:
Made a simple crontab -e pg_dump backup script.
